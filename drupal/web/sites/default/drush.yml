#
# Examples of valid statements for a Drush runtime config (drush.yml) file.
#
# Use this file to cut down on typing out lengthy and repetitive command line
# options in the Drush commands you use and to avoid mistakes.
#
# The Drush configuration system has been factored out and shared with
# the world at https://github.com/consolidation/config. Feel free to use it
# for your projects. Lots more usage information is there.

# Directories and Discovery
#
# Rename this file to drush.yml and copy it to one of the places listed below
# in order of precedence:
#
# 1.  Drupal site folder (e.g. sites/{default|example.com}/drush.yml).
# 2.  Drupal /drush and sites/all/drush folders, or the /drush folder
#       in the directory above the Drupal root.
# 3.  In any location, as specified by the --config (-c) option.
# 4.  User's .drush folder (i.e. ~/.drush/drush.yml).
# 5.  System wide configuration folder (e.g. /etc/drush/drush.yml or C:\ProgramData\Drush\drush.yml).
#
# If a configuration file is found in any of the above locations, it will be
# loaded and merged with other configuration files in the search list.

# Environment variables
#
# Your Drush config file may reference environment variables using a syntax like ${env.home}.
# For example see the drush.paths examples below.
#
# An alternative way to populate Drush configuration is to define environment variables that
# correspond to config keys. For example, to populate the options.uri config item,
# create an environment variable `DRUSH_OPTIONS_URI=http://example.com`.
# As you can see, variable names should be uppercased, prefixed with `DRUSH_`, and periods
# replaced with dashes.

#drush:
#  paths:
    # Specify config files to load.
    #config:
      # Load any personal config files. Is silently skipped if not found. Filename must be drush.yml
      #- ${env.home}/.drush/config/drush.yml


    # Specify folders to search for Drush command files.  These locations
    # are always merged with include paths defined on the command line or
    # in other configuration files.  On the command line, paths may be separated
    # by a colon (:) on Unix-based systems or a semi-colon (;) on Windows,
    # or multiple --include options may be provided. Drush 8 and earlier did
    # a deep search in ~/.drush and /usr/share/drush/commands when loading
    # command files.
    #include:
    #  - '${env.home}/.drush/commands'
    #  - /usr/share/drush/commands

    # Specify the folders to search for Drush alias files (*.site.yml). These
    # locations are always merged with alias paths defined on the command line
    # or in other configuration files.  On the command line, paths may be
    # separated by a colon (:) on Unix-based systems or a semi-colon (;) on
    # Windows, or multiple --alias-path options may be provided. Note that
    # Drush 8 and earlier did a deep search in ~/.drush and /etc/drush when
    # loading alias files.
    #alias-path:
    #  - '${env.home}/.drush/sites'
    #  - /etc/drush/sites

  # Specify the base_url that should be used when generating links.

  # Specify your Drupal core base directory (useful if you use symlinks).
  # Not recommended if you have more than one Drupal root on your system.
