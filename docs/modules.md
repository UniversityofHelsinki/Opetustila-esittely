Modules
=======

The following custom modules are used in this project.

## Module XX
Describe the purpose of any custom modules developed, and any configuration that may be necessary.
If the module implementation is not trivial, please add a description of the module design reasons. Module documentation should be in the module, so this is mostly to document anything related to the module development (tradeoff against existing modules, etc.).

## Drupal.org module YYY
Only list a d.o module, in case any comparison between modules was performed, and describe the conclusions here.
If an existing module was extensively modified, it may be useful to describe those changes here.
